      <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
      <div id="accordion"> 
        <h3>Our Commitment to You</h3>
        <div>
          <p>We are committed to maintaining your confidence and trust, and accordingly maintains the following privacy policy to protect your personal information.</p>

        <div>
          <p>We collect the following types of personal information: names, postal and e-mail addresses, phone and facsimile numbers, billing information, and complaint and inquiry information. We may also collect business information from sole proprietorships that apply for membership or program participation, some of which might constitute personal information, as well as personal information from individuals acting solely in their business capacity. Our online complaint form is hosted by the Council of Better Business Bureaus (CBBB), which processes your complaint according to its own privacy and security policies.<br/><br/>We do not collect or maintain information from those actually known to be under the age of 13, and no part of our site is structured to attract anyone under the age of 13.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>How We May Use Personal Information</h3>
        <div>
          <p>Unless you consent, we will use your personal information for the purpose for which it was submitted such as to reply to inquiries, handle your complaints and process billing and business requests related to program participation, and we will use such information to provide operational notices, and in program recordkeeping and to conduct research on industry marketplace practices.

        <h3>How Your Information May Be Shared</h3>
        <div>
          <p>In order to process complaints against businesses, we will transfer complaints received to the company complained about. It is also possible that a complaint, request or inquiry will be more appropriately handled by another agency, in which case the request or inquiry will be transferred to the proper agency. By completing a complaint form or sending us a request or inquiry, you are allowing us to forward your information to the proper business and also to the proper agency, if necessary. Consumer inquiries may be forwarded by email, and consumers should recognize that this method of transmission may not be secure. We may also share your personal information with the CBBB for CBBB to research industry marketplace practices. Just as in any research we may do, CBBB research will not result in the reporting or publication of any personal information. We never sell or rent personal information.</p>
        <p>We will also release personal information under the following circumstances:<br/><br/>
          • Where release is required by law (for example, a subpoena) or regulation, or is requested by an agency for governmental investigative purposes or governmental proceedings;<br/>
          • Where our records indicate a company may be engaged in fraudulent activity or other deceptive practices that a governmental agency should be made aware of;<br/>
          • To appropriate governmental authorities, where warranted by a company’s failure to participate in our advertising self-regulatory process; or<br/>
          • To appropriate persons, where your communication suggests possible harm to others.</p>
          </div>



          <h3>Help Us Keep Your Personal Information Accurate</h3>
